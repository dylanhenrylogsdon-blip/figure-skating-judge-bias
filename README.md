# Figure Skating Judge Bias Analysis
Figure skating scoring relies on subjective evaluations by panels of judges, raising persistent questions about bias, consistency, and fairness. This project analyzes official ISU judging data using hierarchical statistical models to decompose scoring variance into skater effects, judge effects, and random noise.

The goal is to quantify how much observed score variation is attributable to judges rather than athletes, and to identify systematic patterns of judge bias or inconsistency.
